## Notes

This was a fun exercise to get me more comfortable with the basics of web development. 
I had some issues with the destucturing of the names for the highest and runner up pledge totals as the implementation examples
given on the prework site didn't seem to work for me initially. During the course I think some clarification on what the correct 
implementation is would help me. I also had some problems with implementing the highest and lowest funded sorted arrays 
and I fixed this by using the .toSorted function instead of the .sort function since the .sort function was altering the original array.
